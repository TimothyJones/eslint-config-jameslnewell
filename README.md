# eslint-config-jameslnewell

ESLint config for common gotch'yas for different JS environments.

> Note: I think formatting code is important ([find out why here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/866)) but nowdays
I'm using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to take care of formatting code for  me.
